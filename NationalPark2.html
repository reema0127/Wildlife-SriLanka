                     <p>Udawalawe National Park, situated on the border of Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces in Sri Lanka, was established with the dual purpose of offering
                        a refuge for wildlife displaced during the construction of the Udawalawe Reservoir on the Walawe River and safeguarding the reservoir's catchment
                        area. Spanning an extensive 30,821 hectares (119.00 sq mi), this national park was officially designated on 30 June 1972. <br><br>
                        Prior to its designation, the region served as a space for shifting cultivation, known as chena farming. However, as the national park came
                        into existence, farmers practicing chena farming were gradually relocated. Located 165 kilometres (103 mi) from Colombo, Udawalawe National
                        Park has evolved into a vital habitat for water birds and a stronghold for Sri Lankan elephants. Not only is it a crucial conservation area,
                        but it has also become a favored destination for tourists, ranking as the third-most visited park in the country. The park's significance
                        lies not only in its ecological role but also in its appeal as a popular and accessible wildlife tourism destination in Sri Lanka. <br><br>
                        The habitat surrounding the reservoir encompasses marshes, the Walawe River, its tributaries, as well as forests and grasslands. Within the
                        reservoir, the presence of standing dead trees serves as a visual testament to the extensive forest cover that existed before the construction
                        of the Udawalawe Dam. Various algae, including Pediastrum and Scenedesmus spp., along with blue-green algae such as Microsystis, can be found
                        in the reservoir. The landscape features open grassland, a result of historical chena farming practices. Towards the southern boundary below
                        the dam, there is a teak plantation that predates the park's declaration. <br><br>
                        The recorded species within the park encompass a diverse range: 94 plants, 21 fish, 12 amphibians, 33 reptiles, 184 birds
                        (including 33 migratory species), and 43 mammals. Additionally, the park boasts an array of invertebrates, with 135 species of butterflies
                        identified. This biodiversity showcases the rich and varied ecosystem thriving within the confines of Udawalawe National Park.
