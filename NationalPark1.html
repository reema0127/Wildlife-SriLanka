                <h1>Explore the WildLife of Sri Lanka</h1>
                <p>
                    Sri Lanka boasts a rich tapestry of wildlife, encompassing both its diverse flora and fauna thriving in their natural habitats. Remarkably, the country exhibits one of the highest rates of biological endemism, with 16% of its fauna and 23% of flowering plants being exclusive to the region. The most recent comprehensive update on Sri Lanka's biodiversity was presented in the 6th National Report of the Convention on Biological Diversity. This report, concluding at the end of 2018, offered an up-to-date inventory of species. <br><br>
                    However, subsequent to this report, 54 new species were meticulously documented in 2019. This impressive tally includes 26 spiders (comprising 14 cellar spiders, 7 jumping spiders, 4 crab spiders, and 1 tarantula), 1 scorpion species, 5 mites and ticks, 14 reptiles (13 day geckos and 1 snake), 1 shrub frog, 1 orchid, and 6 lichens. In a subsequent update in 2021, Professors Devaka Weerakoon and Amila Sumanapala released a revised list of taxa, incorporating data up to the conclusion of 2020. <br><br>
                    Sri Lanka's wildlife is exceptionally diverse, housing approximately 123 species of mammals, 185 species of reptiles, 122 species of amphibians, 227 species of birds, and 93 species of freshwater fish. The constant discovery and documentation of new species underscore the ongoing vibrancy and significance of Sri Lanka's unique and thriving ecosystems.

                    <p>The Sinharaja Forest Reserve stands as a crucial biodiversity hotspot in Sri Lanka, holding international significance as evidenced by its designation
                        as a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Recognized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Sinharaja represents
                        the nation's last surviving expanse of primary tropical rainforest. Over 60% of its trees are endemic, with many classified as rare species. The reserve
                        harbors half of Sri Lanka's endemic animal species, encompassing butterflies, amphibians, birds, snakes, and fish. Notably, it serves as a haven for 95%
                        of the country's endemic bird population. <br><br>
                        Situated within the Sri Lanka lowland rain forests ecoregion, the undulating virgin rainforest was safeguarded from extensive commercial logging due to its
                         challenging accessibility. Consequently, it earned the distinction of being a World Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage Site in 1988. <br><br>
           
                        The dense vegetation of Sinharaja poses challenges for wildlife observation compared to drier national parks like Yala. The most prevalent larger mammal
                        within its confines is the endemic purple-faced langur. Avian life thrives in mixed feeding flocks, often led by the fearless Sri Lanka crested drongo and
                         the vocal orange-billed babbler. Among the 26 endemic bird species of Sri Lanka, all 20 rainforest species find their habitat here, featuring elusive species
                         such as the red-faced malkoha, green-billed coucal, and Sri Lanka blue magpie. <br><br>
           
                        The reptile population boasts endemic species like the green pit viper and hump-nosed vipers, while a diverse array of amphibians, particularly tree frogs,
                         contribute to the rich biodiversity. Among the invertebrates, notable residents include the endemic Sri Lankan birdwing butterfly and leeches</p>
